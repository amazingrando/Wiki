    <p>I show up to Spanish study group and Becca had a dead faerie in her purse. It was so cute. And dead. She had to hit the road for some extra-curricular thing (Because doing magic isn't extra-curricular enough for her?). I tried talking with
      <a href="#">James</a> in private, but then one of the new guys from study group is a telepath and he blew our cover. The
      <a href="#" class="new">Irish chick <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i></a> has got faerie connections (Who would have thought?), so she might help us get the little woman to proper rest.</p>

    <p>Despite the group not getting their hands on the alien device, the Dr Dare, Agent Joykill, and Captain Starr managed use the hard drive that was stolen from the Russians to gather intel on the alien device indirectly. What they learned is that the alien pod was basically a large repository of digital information, like a hard drive from space. This pod was attached to a hyper-stellar fusion drive that had been knocked off its original course.</p>

    <blockquote>Deciphering the information in the pod would take time, and unfortunately, direct access to the pod. However the analysis of the pod that was done in the field provided a wealth of information on the engine. This hyper-stellar fusion drive could single-handed power nearly every electronic device on the planet. Used incorrectly, the resulting explosion would take a chunk out of the Earth the size of the moon.</blockquote>
