# Prologue, a starterkit for Amazing Rando Design

This repo is what I typically use to start my Web projects.
* Grunt is used to process everything. (Exploring Gulp is on the horizon.)
* Bower is used to manage common libraries that I like to use.
* SASS is my CSS preprocessor of choice, though I'm just as familiar with LESS.
* SWIG is used for HTML/PHP templates.
